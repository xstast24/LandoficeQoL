URL matching https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/match_patterns/ used e.g. in manifest.json -> permissions & content_scripts -> matches
"http://*.landofice.com/*" matches all landofice domains, heaven.landofice.com, landofice.com, www.landofice.com

ICONS
Chrome icon requirements: https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/icons
Create icons in https://www.mathcha.io/editor (vector graphics), then download HD png & use e.g. https://www.online-image-editor.com to rectangle-crop it and resize to 128px
Or we could download SVG and convert to png while setting a desired re-size (vector scales to whatever size we need with no compression loss),
but I tried ~10 online svg→png tools and 3 not working, 3 generated the img incorrectly, the rest didn't allow size setting. It is easier to just crop PNG.

TODO upgrade to manifest v3 v2 is supported only until Jan 2023 https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-migration/

How to not execute then after failed promise? Handle success as needed, but in the error case re-raise the promise rejection:
error => {console.error('Quick attack action failed: ', error); return Promise.reject(error)} //keep the promise rejected -> the following "then" won't execute

WebStorm reformat selected code (align etc.): Ctrl+Alt+L or Cmd+Option+L

Convert HTMLCollection to array: Array.from(collection)

Promise then handling scenarios mechanism explained (by observation):
/**
 * If func returns Promise.resolve(), it is passed to then's success result handle. Following then gets anything returned by the previous then as a success result,
 * if the previous then didn't return anything, then "undefined" is passed (still as success result). Fail result is given ONLY if somebody returned Promise.reject(r).
 * If func returns Promise.rejected(), it is passed to then's failure handle. If there is no failure handle in then X, it is skipped and fail result is passed
 * to then X+N which handles the failure. If no then handled it, it is passed to the closest "catch" branch.
 In other words:
 - If "then" returns anything (or no return = undefined), it is counted as success and passed to the next "then" success handle.
 - The initial function must return Promise.resolve/reject, if it doesn't, the following "then" won't happen at all.
    On the other hand, "then" can return anything and it is passed down as success result.
 - If function or "then" returns Promise.rejected(f), it is passed to the closest "then" that has failure handle, or to "catch" if no then has failure handle.
 - If there is no uncaught Promise.rejected(), "catch" clause won't happen at all.

 Override default CSS style of the webpage -> use !important tag in custom CSS like this: "width: 350px !important"
